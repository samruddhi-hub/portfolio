							<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p style="font-size:medium; width: 75%;color: #EDE5CC;">Food that is left over generally ends up in the waste bin while hundreds go empty stomach to bed every night. It is important to make sure this food reaches the ones who need it. <br> While the idea is simple, execution would need many entities to come together and work together as a team for a noble cause. By creating two main units — receivers and donors, we can have a chance at executing this systematically and efficiently.</p> <br>

								<div class="image-txt-container">
									
									<p style="padding-right: 20px; color: #C9935f; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">
										I wanted to understand how food that is left over at events or in offices is managed and come up with a plan to save it from going to waste. <br> Each year several non-profit organisations deliver food to people that would otherwise be wasted. The inspiration for this capstone project came from wanting to establish a better communication platform between people and such organizations. <br> <br> However, during the needfinding process, I realized there are individuals too that would like to share their extra food from small office gatherings or dinner parties with those around them but fail to do so due to a lack of connectivity with potential receivers.
									<br><br>
									<span style="padding-right: 20px; color: #EDE5CC ; text-align: left;">
										From the pool of ideas, I zeroed in on one: <br> an app that connects people who wish to share food with those nearby looking for food. <br> Like a dating app but for food or like Facebook marketplace but without cost.

							<h2 style="color: #EDE5CC;margin:0 0 10px 0;">Storyboarding and Prototyping</h2>

							<p style="color: #C9935f; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">Next step after selecting viable ideas was to storyboard them. This gave me an idea of the potential use cases and overview of the interactions users will have with the final product.</p>

						</div><br>

						<p style="color: #C9935f; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">After spending time on developing a basic workflow of how the app would work, the next step was to wireframe the screens.
						</p>

						<div class="zuzu">
							<img src="Exports/sbwireframe.png" style="width:90%;">
							<p style="color:#EDE5CC; font-size:80%;text-align: center; opacity: 0.35;">Wireframe for ShareBread</p>
					</div><br>

					<p style="color: #C9935f; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">With a baseline user interface, next task was to find usability issue and fix them. <br> With the help of my peers, I conducted heuristic evaluation of the wireframes. This helped me make my prototype more user friendly. There were plenty of consistency issues and recognition faults.<br><span style="color: #EDE5CC;"> Having fixed this, I planned the further steps in detail and created a mockup prototype for user testing to further unearth any issues.</span>
					</p>

					<h2 style="color: #EDE5CC;margin:0 0 0 0;">User Testing</h2><br>

					<div class="image-txt-container">
						
						<img src="Exports/sbuser.png" style="width: 40%;">
						<p style="padding-left: 20px; color: #EDE5CC; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">
							First I conducted an in-person user test where I watched the participants use the prototype. <br><br> The scenario I presented to them was as follows:<br>
You have leftover food and wish to share it with someone in your nearby area. Or you wish to look if anyone has food they wish to share and get it from them.
						<br><br>
						<span style="color: #C9935f; font-size:90%; text-align: left;">
							The users were instructed to talk out loud while they were performing the task and what they were thinking while performing the task.
						</span></p>
				</div>
					
				<h2 style="color: #EDE5CC;margin:2em 0 0 0;">A/B Testing</h2><br>

				<p style="padding-left: 20px; color: #EDE5CC; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">
					Next up, I conducted A/B testing. <br> Here I made 2 changes to the previous prototype and presented it to users. </p>
							<ul style="padding-left: 20px; color: #EDE5CC; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">
								<li>Prototype A had a two column list type for viewing available food and a map where users can drop a pin to their current location. </li>
								<li>Prototype B had a single item displayed per page and user needed to swipe to view all items and for the location, a drop down list was used.</li> </ul>
								<p style="padding-left: 20px; color: #EDE5CC; font-size:80%;text-align: left;">
								The task given to the testers was the same task given to users during user testing.
<br><br>I used the platform <a href="www.usertesting.com" style="color: #ede5cc;"> UserTesting</a> to conduct A/B testing. <br> Four users were given the prototypes to test. Each user encountered different issues and gave detailed insights and reviews. <br> While all users reported to having found navigation on the app easy, they preferred the version A as they could view available items easily on one single page.

						<br><br>
						<span style="color: #C9935f; text-align: left;">
							In the final iteration of the design, I added a few final touches made changes taking user research into account which led to adding some key aspects to the interface.
						</span></p>
